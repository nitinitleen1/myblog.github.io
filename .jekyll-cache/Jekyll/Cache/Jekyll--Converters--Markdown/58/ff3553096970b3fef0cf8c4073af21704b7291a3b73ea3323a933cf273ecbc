I"½<p>GCPâ€™s Load balancers are globally scalable and its the unique identify for GCP while comparing its competitors. Generally GCPâ€™s networking is very strong and mature than other Cloud providers.  Recently I was working with a SQL Server setup which integrates the GCP Internal TCP load balancer. During that PoC setup I found this strange behaviour and then I ignored this problem because I thought its something related to SQL server.</p>
