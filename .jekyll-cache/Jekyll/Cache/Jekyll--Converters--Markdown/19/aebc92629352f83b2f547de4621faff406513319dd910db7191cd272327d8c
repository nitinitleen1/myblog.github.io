I"<p>When you installed the Debezium MySQL connector, then itâ€™ll start read your historical data and push all of them into the Kafka topics. This setting can we changed via <code class="highlighter-rouge">snapshot.mode</code> parameter in the connector. But if you are going to start a new sync, then Debezium will load the existing data its called Snapshot. Unfortunately, if you have a busy transactional MySQL database, then it may lead to some performance issues. And your DBA will never agree to read the data from Master Node.[Disclaimer: Iâ€™m a DBA :) ]. So I was thinking of figuring out to take the snapshot from the Read Replica, once the snapshot is done, then start read the realtime data from the Master. I found this useful information in a StackOverflow answer.</p>
