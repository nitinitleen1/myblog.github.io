I" <p>While reading this title you may think about what this guy is going to do? Its all about <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter">JMX exporter</a> from prometheus and Grafana. Yes, its already implemented by many companies and Grafana has some cool dashboards. But as a DBA, in <a href="https://medium.com/Searce">Searce</a> we are managing many customers and all of them are using many types of databases. So from a DBAâ€™s perspective to monitor  all databases in one place is always a great thing right. If you are a MySQL DBA, then you must have heard about <a href="https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management">PMM</a>. Its an awesome monitoring tool and its open source. Also it has Dashboards for Linux metrics, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.</p>
