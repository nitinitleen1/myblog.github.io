I"Ò<p>In a DBAâ€™s day to day activities, we are doing Archive operation on our transnational database servers to improve your queries and control the Disk space. The archive is a most expensive operation since its involved a huge number ofÂ ReadÂ and Write will be performed. So its mandatory to run the archive queries in chunks. The archive is depended on businessÂ use. Many of us need a copy of the data on an archive database to refer later. To perform the archive we can just simply run the delete query with the limit. But we need to run the query again and again until the matched rows count is 0. We can create a procedure to do this in a while loop. I have created one such procedure to archive many tables.Â </p>
