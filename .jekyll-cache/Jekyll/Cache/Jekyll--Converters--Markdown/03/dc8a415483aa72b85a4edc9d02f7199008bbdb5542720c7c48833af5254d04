I"N<p>AWS Glue is the serverless version of EMR clusters. Many organizations now adopted to use Glue for their day to day BigData workloads. I have written a blog in Searceâ€™s Medium publication for Converting the CSV/JSON files to parquet using AWS Glue. Till now its many people are reading that and implementing on their infra. But many people are commenting about the Glue is producing a huge number for output files(converted Parquet files) in S3, even for converting 100MB of CSV file will produce 500+ Parquet files. we need to customize this output file size and number of files.</p>
