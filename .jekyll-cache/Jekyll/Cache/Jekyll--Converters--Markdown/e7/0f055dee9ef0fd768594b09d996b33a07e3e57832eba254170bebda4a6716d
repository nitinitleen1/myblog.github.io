I"³<p>In my <a href="https://thedataguy.in/debezium-mysql-snapshot-from-read-replica-with-gtid/">previous post</a>, I have shown you how to take the snapshot from Read Replica with GTID for Debezium  MySQL connector. GTID concept is awesome, but still many of us using the replication without GTID. For these cases, we can take a snapshot from Read replica and then manually push the Master binlog information to the offsets topic. Injecting manual entry for offsets topic is <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/faq/#how_to_change_the_offsets_of_the_source_database">already documented in Debezium</a>. Iâ€™m just guiding you the way to take snapshot from Read replica without GTID.</p>
