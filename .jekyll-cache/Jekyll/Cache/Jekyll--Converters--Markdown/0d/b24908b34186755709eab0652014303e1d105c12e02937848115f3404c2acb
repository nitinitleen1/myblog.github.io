I"¿<p>Adding a new node to the MongoDB replica set with huge amount of data will take a lot of time to perform the initial sync. Recently I was working on a replica set where I need to replace all the nodes in the existing shard and add a new node to the shardâ€™s replica set. The data size is 3TB on each shard. The entire infra is on GCP. I planned to do this activity with native approach, but later I realized it wonâ€™t work as I expected.</p>
