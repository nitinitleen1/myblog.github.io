  <p><strong>Short Story:</strong>Â TheÂ <a href="https://dbatools.io/">dbatoolsÂ </a>is growing too fast, so many Powershell modules are there. I just compared the backup module with Ola Hallengrenâ€™s backup script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who all are working as a SQL Server DBA, we must be scheduled the backup job in SQL Agent with our own TSQL scripts. But most of the DBAs are recommended to use Ola hallengrenâ€™s backup script. Because it gives us a reliable backup and easy to locate the backup files. Iâ€™m also a fan of Olaâ€™s script. Im using this in my all production servers.</p>

<p>I had a situation to create a backup maintenance job without SQL agent. Oh god, this is not fair. There are so many ways available to configure this, but without SQL agentâ€¦.. there is a question mark. OK fine, I had an Option, PowerShell in Task Scheduler. Instead of using SQL PowerShell module to take the backup, I have executed the olaâ€™s backup commands inside the PowerShell. Yes, this is good, its working as I expected. But the problem is sometimes it didnâ€™t work and I donâ€™t have any logs for that. So I decided to use dbatools. I have compared many options with olaâ€™s scripts. Lets see the results.</p>

<p>I have AdventureWorks and WideWorldImporters database on my computer and I have SSD Storage.</p>

<p><strong>Backup Folder:</strong></p>

<p>In Olaâ€™s scripts creates the backup folders as more predictable. Its pretty good to find a backup file. dbatools are has this option but it doesnâ€™t create a folder based on backup type.</p>

<p><strong>Backup Time:</strong></p>

<p>Olaâ€™s backup took 5 sec to take the backup, dbatools tookÂ <em>10sec</em>. Oh its pretty slow.</p>

<p><strong>Backup File Names:</strong></p>

<p>In Olaâ€™s scripts, the backup file contains a keyword for backup types, like Full, Diff. dbatools doesnâ€™t have this one. It just creates the file likeÂ <em>Datababsename_yyyymmddhhmmss.bak</em></p>

<p><strong>Copy Only:</strong></p>

<p>dbatools is taking all the backups with Copy Only, but in Olaâ€™s script you need to addÂ <em>@Copyonly=â€™Yâ€™</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Stats Message:</strong></p>

<p>Olaâ€™s scripts are giving a more detailed message for backups, like Is standby, Recovery Model, Encrypted, Differential LSN, but dbatools gives limited details only.</p>

<p><strong>Cleanup:</strong></p>

<p>Olaâ€™s scripts have the cleanup option in the same module, dbatools you need to execute Backup-Remove module to clean up.</p>

<p><strong>Verify, Checksum, Compress:</strong></p>

<p>These options are same on both sides.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the Winner?</strong></p>

<p>dbatools are not only for backups, its taking care a dbaâ€™s work, so we canâ€™t say this is not good for backups, they are doing as much as they can. But olaâ€™s scripts too good for Backups. Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encrypted backups</li>
  <li>Backup to multiple locations</li>
  <li>Backup to Azure Blob</li>
  <li>Cleanup</li>
  <li>Integrate with third party backup tools.</li>
  <li>and more options.</li>
</ul>
