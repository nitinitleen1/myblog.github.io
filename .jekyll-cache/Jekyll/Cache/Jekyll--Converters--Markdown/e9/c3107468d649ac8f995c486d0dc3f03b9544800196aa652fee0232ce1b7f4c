I"¦<p>Debezium is providing out of the box CDC solution from various databases. In my last blog post, I have published how to configure the Debezium MySQL connector. This is the next part of that post. Once we deployed the debezium, to we need some kind of monitoring to keep track of whats happening in the debezium connector. Luckily Debezium has its own metrics that are already integrated with the connectors. We just need to capture them using the JMX exporter agent. Here I have written how to monitor Debezium MySQL connector with Prometheus and Grafana. But the dashboard is having the basic metrics only. You can build your own dashboard for more detailed monitoring.</p>
