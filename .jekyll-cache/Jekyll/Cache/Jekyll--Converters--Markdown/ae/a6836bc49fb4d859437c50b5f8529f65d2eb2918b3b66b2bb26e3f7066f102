I"ð<p>If you are dealing with the realtime data stream from Kinesis to RedShift, then you may face this situation where Redshift was down due to some maintenance activity and kinesis firehose was not able to ingest the data. But it has awesome features to retry after the next 60 Minutes. I had a situation that, there was a password change on the RedShift cluster on staging infra and we didnâ€™t notice that the data load was failing. Now we need to backfill all those data into redshift using manifest files. One simple way, list all the files in errors manifest folders and generate the copy command and run those commands in loop or import as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sql</code> file. But I wanted to automate this process with lambda.</p>
