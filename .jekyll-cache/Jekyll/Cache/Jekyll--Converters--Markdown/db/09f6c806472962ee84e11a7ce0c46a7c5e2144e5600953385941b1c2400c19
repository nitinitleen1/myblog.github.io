<p>RedShift <code class="highlighter-rouge">unload</code> function will help us to export/unload the data from the tables to S3 directly. It actually runs a select query to get the results and them store them into S3. But unfortunately, it supports only one table at a time. You need to create a script to get the all the tables then store it in a variable, and loop the unload query with the list of tables. Here I have done with PL/SQL way to handle this. You can Export/Unload all the tables to S3 with partitions.</p>
