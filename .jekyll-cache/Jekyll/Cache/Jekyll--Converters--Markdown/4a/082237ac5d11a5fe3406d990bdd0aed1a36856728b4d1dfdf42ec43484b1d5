I"]<p>Kinesis Firehose is pushing the realtime data to S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, and Splunk for realtime/Near real-time analytics. Sometime the target may not available due to maintenance or any reason. So the Kinesis will automatically push the data to S3 and create the manifest file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">errors</code> directory. Then later we can reload the data into our targets. But unfortunately, there is no one-step action to set notification if the load is failed. In this blog, im writing how can we setup Cloudwatch custom log filter alarm for kinesis load failed events.</p>
