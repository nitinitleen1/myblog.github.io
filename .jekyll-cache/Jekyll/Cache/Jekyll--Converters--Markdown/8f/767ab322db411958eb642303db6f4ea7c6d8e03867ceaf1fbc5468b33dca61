I"Ê<p>Its not the new term for DBAs. MySQL has an awesome parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">innodb-file-per-tables</code> allows MySQL to create separate files for each tables. This helped a lot to manage the disk space in more efficient way. But when we perform a large batch job for delete or update the data in MySQL tables, you may face this fragmentation issue. Comparing with SQL server, MySQLâ€™s fragmentation is not high. I had a similar situation where my Disk space was consuming 80% and when I check the huge files in OS, one tableâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">idb</code> file consumed 300GB+. I know it has some wasted blocks(but not actually wasted, MySQL will use this space, itâ€™ll not return this to OS) Then I checked the <code class="highlighter-rouge">information schema</code> to find out the data size and its index size. It was 27GB only. Then I realize, we did a batch operation to delete many billions of records in that table.</p>
