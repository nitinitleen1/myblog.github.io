I was looking for a portable Git GUI Client and I finally have found what I wanted, it is [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/).

SmartGit is a smart, intuitive and easy Git client much suited for beginners like me. It has a rich interface full of features, is light on disk and works 
right out-of-the box.

I was surprised to see that it supersedes Github native client when the ease of usage is compared and so becomes the best tools for git beginners in my view.

A portable version of SmartGit can be downloaded from [Syntevo's site](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/download).
The portable version ships with the needed Java Runtime Environment files (JRE) and doesn't interfere with the installed Java version.
SmartGit requires [Git](http://git-scm.com) to be installed and luckily Windows version of Git ( [mysisgit](http://mysisgit.github.io)) comes with a portable version.
The portable version can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=1&q=portable+.7z&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+ReleaseDate+Size+DownloadCount">Google code downloads 
repository</a>.

**Note** - Google Code is deprecating downloads so you may probably will not see mysisgit downloads there if you are reading this after Mar 2014.
For `25/1/2014`, the latest version of portable mysisgit can be downloaded from <a href="http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/PortableGit-1.8.5.2-preview20131230.7z">this link.</a>

Once you have downloaded and unzipped portable git (mysisgit), you can put it in the SmartGit folder as below.<br>

Then run SmartGitHg.exe from the bin folder, follow the instructions and you are all set up for managing your git projects.

**CAUTION** - The folder structures as used in this post <i>may</i> differ from the original portable version as I am using a custom launcher.
