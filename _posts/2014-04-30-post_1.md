title: The old Poole theme
---

<div class="notify"><span class="symbol icon-info"></span> This theme is now replaced by the <a href="/blog/the-theme.html">Solar theme</a>.</div>

This theme has been derived from [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo)'s project [poole](http://getpoole.com). I needed a theme to suit both [blogs](/blog) and 
[project pages](/ahk) and @mdo's themes where just the perfect thing to start off with.  
Thank you **mdo** !!  

This post mainly contains notes for myself and should be useful to anyone using this theme.


#### Major Edits in the Theme
* `Pages` are more wider.
* No dynamic `sidebar`, instead a semi-dynamic list where the `Github` link changes as per the page active.
  
  
#### Custom page parameters available
* `favicon: 1` - Specify to have the favicon loaded from the folder of the page.
* `desc: some description` - Add `meta description` tag for the page.
* `highlight: 1` - Loads [Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) for the page. I use SyntaxHighlighter and not the default 'Pygments' because it 
 doesn't support AutoHotkey.
* `ghlink: http://github.com/a/b` - Specify Github URL to have the left hidden sidebar load it and display as '**{title}** on Github'.
* `nod: 1` - Disable Disqus for the page. Disqus_Id is specified in _config.yml.
  
  
#### Where to use which layout ?
 > Use layout `page` for static page, `post` for a blog post and `default` for a static page that shows only brief information.
