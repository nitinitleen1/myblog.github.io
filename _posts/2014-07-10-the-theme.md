This theme has been customized from the [Solar theme](http://redwallhp.github.io/solar-theme-jekyll/) by [@redwallhp](http://github.com/redwallhp).  
Various features of theme are as follows -  
  
#### Seamless Disqus integration
Just specify `disqus_id`, the forumname of your site in the `_config.yml` file and the disqus will be integrated to the site. For blog posts, the `disqus_identifier` is 
made dynamically so that you don't lose your comments if the link to the post changes. Same is for other static pages of the site.  
The `disqus_identifier` for a post is generated as

    {% raw %}var disqus_identifier = "{{ site.disqusid }}/{{ page.date | date: "%Y/%m/%d" }}{{ page.id | replace: '/blog','' }}";{% endraw %}

An example of produced disqus_identifier is `avi-aryan-github/2014/01/26/smartgit-portable-github-client` . Thus your comments will be preserved even if you change your 
domain or use a URL such as `http://www.mysite.com/blog/post/index.html` instead of `http://www.mysite.com/blog/post` or `http://www.mysite.com/blog/post/`.
  
#### Fast Load time
The page uses no javascript, jquery and bootstrap and so will load like a local HTML page & this was one of the main reasons I chose to start with the Solar theme.
  
#### Left side box
The left side box can be used to display important messages and anything else you like. By default, it is configured to display latest posts from the blog when you are 
browsing one of the static pages of the site AND display available tags and categories when you are browsing blog posts.
  
#### Social Share buttons
Each blog post has buttons to share post on Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.
  
#### Tags and Categories
Posts are listed by tags and categories at `blog/tags.html` and `blog/categories.html`. See available <a href="/blog/tags.html">tags</a> and 
<a href="/blog/categories.html">categories</a> for my site.
  
#### More features
You can find more features of this [blog post](post_1.html) which was regarding the previous theme of this blog. I will update this page later with precise information.

# Q/A
#### Why use .html extension for blog pages instead of the fancier `blog/title/` type ?
Using the `.html` extension prevents creating of extra folders by Jekyll each of which will contain index.html as the blog post. This speeds us building process and maybe 
helps with disk fragmentation.
