My new laptop didn't had a CapsLock LED so I decided to make a little tool (in AutoHotkey) which shows the caps-lock status in the system tray.

The Caps-lock ON and OFF icons are distributed as single icon files so you can edit them to suit your visual aesthetics.  
You can download this tool from [my dropbox](http://pastebin.com/raw/LnibQhqn) or see the source on [github](https://github.com/aviaryan/autohotkey-scripts/tree/master/Tools/capslockstatus)  

<div class="notify">If for some reason CapsLockStatus's icon is not shown in the status bar, go to <b>Customize Notification Icons</b> and then 
	make CapsLockStatus show "icon and notifications"</div>

I hope someone finds this handy !!
