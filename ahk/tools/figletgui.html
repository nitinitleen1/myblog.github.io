<br><br>
FigletGUI is a GUI wrapper for the commandline application <a href="http://www.figlet.org">Figlet</a>.<br>
It is a windows-only application that was created to make working with Figlet easy.<br>
<br>
FigletGUI (Figui) is a portable standalone applcation that requires Figlet.exe to be present in the same directory as it for things to work.
Optionally a 'fonts' directory with Figlet 3rd party fonts may also be present to load these fonts in the application.<br>
<br>
A Figlet.exe packaged with many fonts can be download from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aviaryan/files/figletgui/Figlet.zip/download">this project's repository</a> on Sourceforge.
<br><br>

<h3>Some Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>After running FigletGUI.exe for the first time, a figui.ini is created. You can add the <code>preferred_font</code> in there.
    <li>To see preview of your text in different fonts, click on Font List to activate it. Then you can use Up and Down keys to change fonts and so see previews in 
        them.
